# Project-Gas-Detecting-Alarm-system-with-Arduino.
Project Description: In this project, I make a gas detecting alarm system using an Arduino and a gas sensor and display messages using an LCD. It has also 2 Led Indicator for Safe &amp; Warning detection. We will use a gas sensor to detect like LPG, Carbon-Mono-Oxide, Methane, Butane. It will display warning &amp; sound the buzzer to warn &amp; visualize status with Led indicator. To make this project, I used Tinker cad simulator by Autodesk.
